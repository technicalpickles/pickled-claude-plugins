Fix tool routing to use .tmp/ with timestamps to avoid worktree collisions

Updates git-commit-multiline and gh-pr-create-multiline routing rules to use
project-local .tmp/ directory with timestamped filenames instead of /tmp.

Changes:
- Redirect to .tmp/commit-msg-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.txt (was /tmp/commit-msg.txt)
- Redirect to .tmp/pr-body-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md (was /tmp/pr-body.md)
- Add test fixtures for both routing rules
- Document .tmp/ usage and global gitignore setup
- Add design document in docs/plans/

Benefits:
- No collisions when working across multiple worktrees/projects
- Chronological history preserved in .tmp/
- Human-readable timestamps for debugging
- Files stay local to project (easier to find)

All 53 tests pass including new fixtures.
