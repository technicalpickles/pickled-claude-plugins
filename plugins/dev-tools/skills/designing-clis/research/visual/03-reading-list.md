# CLI Visual Design & Terminal Aesthetics — Annotated Reading List

## 1. The Visual Display of Quantitative Information — Edward Tufte
A foundational work on clarity in data visualization. Teaches how to remove noise and structure information for fast, intuitive scanning — principles directly applicable to CLI output.
- Concepts: signal-to-noise ratio, visual hierarchy, data density
- Emphasis on clarity over decoration

## 2. The Design of Everyday Things — Don Norman
A design classic that unpacks how products communicate through signifiers and feedback. CLI commands, outputs, and layouts can borrow heavily from this cognitive approach.
- Emphasis on user expectations, affordances, visibility
- Useful for designing intuitive CLI interactions

## 3. Universal Principles of Design — Lidwell, Holden, Butler
A compact guide to 125 design principles like proximity, alignment, and visibility — critical for visually organizing terminal output.
- Broad, high-level design heuristics
- Direct mapping to CLI concerns: structure, discoverability, accessibility

## 4. Command Line Interface Guidelines (CLIG)
A community-built guide to CLI design best practices. Covers conventions, flag design, help output, and user-centered language.
- https://clig.dev
- Human-first, convention-respecting, clarity-focused

## 5. "10 Design Principles for Delightful CLIs" — Atlassian Forge Blog
A friendly guide on making CLIs delightful to use. Encourages visual feedback, guidance, and sensible error messaging.
- https://atlassian.design/blog/cli-design-principles
- Great examples for clarity and user flow in text UIs

## 6. Terminal Aesthetics — rtvd (GitHub Repository)
A deep dive into how terminal visuals work, from ANSI color codes to typography and contrast.
- https://github.com/rtvd/terminal-aesthetics
- Explores readability, color contrast, design for dark/light terminals

## 7. Rich (Python Library)
Python package for building beautiful CLI output with formatting, tables, markdown rendering, and live updating widgets.
- https://github.com/Textualize/rich
- Enables expressive structure and feedback in Python CLIs

## 8. Chalk (Node.js Library)
Minimalist color and style utility for Node-based CLI tools. Use it to highlight errors, success, and labels.
- https://github.com/chalk/chalk
- Color-coding and emphasis to improve scannability

## 9. Blessed (Node.js Terminal UI Framework)
A library for building full TUIs in the terminal, with panels, inputs, buttons, and keybindings.
- https://github.com/chjj/blessed
- Great for creating GUI-like CLI layouts with strong structure and interaction

## 10. "The Art of Building Delightful CLIs" — Atlan Engineering
A modern case study on CLI UX. Covers discoverability, naming, default behavior, and emotional tone.
- https://atlan.com/blog/cli-design/
- Blends design principles into a real-world CLI success story
