## 🎓 Foundational UX Theory — *Why Humans Behave This Way*

### 1. [Don Norman – *The Design of Everyday Things* (Book, 1988 / Revised 2013)](https://www.nngroup.com/books/design-everyday-things-revised-and-expanded-edition/)
> “Design is really an act of communication.”  
Norman’s timeless classic explains how affordances, feedback, and error recovery shape intuitive design. These ideas are central to making CLIs that “talk back” clearly and allow users to explore safely.

### 2. [Steve Krug – *Don’t Make Me Think* (Book, 2000)](https://sensible.com/dmmt.html)
> “Don’t make me think.”  
A witty, accessible guide to usability and simplicity. Krug’s philosophy is the essence of good CLI design — predictable commands, minimal friction, and a sense that everything “just works.”

### 3. [Jakob Nielsen – *10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design* (Article, 1994)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
> “Visibility of system status.”  
Nielsen’s principles — like feedback, error prevention, and consistency — directly inform CLI UX. They explain why feedback loops (spinners, messages, progress bars) build user confidence.

### 4. [Alan Cooper – *About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design* (Book, 1995 / 4th Ed. 2014)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/About+Face%3A+The+Essentials+of+Interaction+Design%2C+4th+Edition-p-9781118766576)
> “Design for the user’s goals, not their tasks.”  
A deep dive into goal-oriented design and error forgiveness. Helps CLI designers think beyond commands to user intent — creating tools that feel supportive and responsive.

## 💡 Modern UX and Interface Design Writing

### 5. [Luke Wroblewski – *Designing for Interaction in Constrained Environments* (Article, 2010)](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1847)
> “Constraints drive creativity.”  
Explores how tight spaces (like mobile or terminal environments) inspire hierarchy, concise feedback, and smart defaults — lessons tailor-made for CLI interfaces.

### 6. [Julie Zhuo – *The Making of a Manager* (Book, 2019)](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book)
> “Good design starts with empathy.”  
Not just for managers — Zhuo’s reflection on communication and clarity helps designers treat the CLI as a two-way dialogue with the user.

### 7. [Scott Jenson – *The UX of Command Lines* (Blog Post, 2016)](https://medium.com/@scottjenson/the-ux-of-command-lines-3d1c6ac4e0b4)
> “The command line is the purest interface.”  
A thoughtful essay arguing that command lines can be elegant and discoverable if designed intentionally. A great bridge between classic UX and modern developer tools.

### 8. [Tom MacWright – *Interface Without Interface* (Blog Post, 2019)](https://macwright.com/2019/03/08/interface-without-interface.html)
> “The best interface is the one you don’t notice.”  
MacWright’s minimalist philosophy encourages restraint — helping CLI designers know when to remove, not add, features or output.
