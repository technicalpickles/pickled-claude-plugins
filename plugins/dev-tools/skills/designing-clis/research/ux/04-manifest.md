# 🎨 CLI UX Manifesto: Designing for Delight in the Terminal

### A Design Philosophy for the Modern Command Line

The command line is one of the oldest user interfaces — yet today, it’s experiencing a renaissance. Tools like **Claude Code**, **GitHub CLI**, **Lazygit**, **Broot**, and **Warp** show that a terminal can be fast, discoverable, and even *delightful*. The best CLIs now blend the speed of text with the clarity and warmth of thoughtful UX. This manifesto distills the shared philosophy behind those experiences — a call to build terminals that feel as good as they are powerful.

## 1. Familiarity is Empowerment
The best CLIs feel instantly recognizable. They honor established conventions so users can transfer their knowledge from one tool to the next. Reuse known verbs, flags, and structures — not to copy, but to reduce friction.  
> *Predictability builds trust. Surprise breaks flow.*

---

## 2. Make the Invisible Discoverable
A CLI should guide, not gatekeep. Great tools reveal themselves — through clear help text, interactive prompts, and completion hints. Every command is a chance to teach.  
> *A good CLI says: “Try me this way.”*

---

## 3. Always Talk Back
Feedback turns commands into conversations. A silent terminal leaves users guessing; a responsive one reassures. Use progress indicators, confirmations, and success messages to show that the system is alive and listening.  
> *A CLI that speaks keeps users in sync with their work.*

---

## 4. Format for the Human Eye
Structure is interface. The difference between noise and clarity is in how information is arranged. Use spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy to make text scannable.  
> *Good output is like a well-set table — organized, inviting, and easy to navigate.*

---

## 5. Flow Is Sacred
Every keystroke counts. Respect the rhythm of skilled users by keeping interactions fast, flexible, and interruptible. Support scripting, shortcuts, and sensible defaults.  
> *A great CLI feels like momentum, not friction.*

---

## 6. Design for Forgiveness
Errors are inevitable; frustration isn’t. Use plain language, suggest fixes, and make it safe to experiment. The user who feels safe to fail will go farther.  
> *Kindness is a UX pattern.*

---

## 7. Include Everyone
Accessibility is polish. Don’t rely on color alone, respect different environments, and make language approachable. When you design for inclusivity, everyone benefits.  
> *Empathy is compatibility.*

---

### The Core Belief
**A CLI is not just a text interface — it’s a conversation.** Each command, flag, and line of output is part of a dialogue between human and machine. The more that dialogue feels clear, responsive, and humane, the more powerful the command line becomes.

> *The terminal is a canvas. Design with empathy, clarity, and rhythm — and your users will feel it every time they type.*
