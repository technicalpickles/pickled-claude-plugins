## 🎯 CLI UX Research – Master Prompt (Readable, Example-Rich Style)

### **Research Goal**
Explore what makes modern, polished command-line interfaces (CLIs) — like Claude Code, GitHub CLI, `lazygit`, `broot`, `warp`, and others — feel so smooth, intuitive, and even *delightful* to use.

The goal is to uncover **core design principles** that explain *why* these interfaces work well, connect those principles to **general UX theory**, and show **how real tools demonstrate them in practice** — all written in an approachable, human voice.

---

### 🧠 **Phase 1: The Why — Understanding Modern CLI UX**
- Identify and explain the **core UX ideas** that make today’s CLIs effective and engaging.
- Use plain, relatable language — less “academic framework,” more “design storytelling.”
- Include examples for each principle: e.g. how `lazygit` communicates system state clearly, or how Claude Code uses structure and feedback to make interaction feel fluid.
- For each idea:
  - Define it simply
  - Explain why it matters
  - Show a real CLI example that demonstrates it

**Expected Output:**  
A readable overview of CLI UX principles, written like a design essay — clear, visual, and example-driven.

---

### ⚙️ **Phase 2: The How — Making It Real**
- Translate those principles into **practical, framework-agnostic guidance** for builders.
- Use friendly, instructive tone (“Try this…” “Avoid that…” “Here’s a trick to make feedback feel faster…”).
- Cover aspects like layout, color, flow, discoverability, accessibility, and interaction rhythm.
- Include real examples when explaining: how certain tools balance structure, visual cues, and responsiveness.

**Expected Output:**  
A readable, actionable guide for designing expressive, user-friendly CLIs — something that feels like a cross between a UX blog post and a design field guide.

---

### 📚 **Phase 3: The Reading List — Learning from the Broader UX World**
- Curate a **short, annotated reading list** with accessible resources that deepen understanding.
- Include a mix of:
  - UX design classics (e.g. Norman, Krug, Nielsen)
  - Modern articles or talks about terminal and developer experience design
- For each resource:
  - Write 1–2 sentences on why it’s worth reading
  - Keep the summaries conversational and approachable

**Expected Output:**  
A list of recommended readings for designers and developers who want to “think like a UX designer” while building CLIs.

---

### 🧩 **Deliverables Summary**
- **Readable CLI UX Principles Guide** → what modern CLIs do well, in plain language with examples  
- **Practical Builder’s Guide** → how to apply those ideas in your own CLI projects  
- **Friendly Reading List** → accessible resources to explore UX thinking further

---

### ✍️ **Tone & Style Notes for ChatGPT**
- Prioritize *clarity, warmth, and insight* over formality.
- Use approachable analogies (“like how a good UI nudges you forward, not makes you guess”).
- Break up long text with lists, headers, and short paragraphs.
- Reference real tools naturally, like you’re walking through them with the reader.
- Think *UX blog post* or *design field note*, not *academic whitepaper*.

---

### 🚀 **Optional Extensions (for Future Iterations)**
- Create a visual or narrative “CLI UX Design Principles” summary.
- Build a heuristics checklist for evaluating CLI UX quality.
- Compare tools (e.g. Claude Code vs `lazygit`) to see how different design approaches express the same principle.
