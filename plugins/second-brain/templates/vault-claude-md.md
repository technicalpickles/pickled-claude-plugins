# {Vault Name}

> See `second-brain:obsidian` skill for tool conventions.

## Structure

- {inbox_folder}/ - New captures before routing
- {daily_folder}/ - Daily notes, quick captures
- Projects/ - Active work with deadlines
- Areas/ - Ongoing responsibilities
- Resources/ - Reference material
- Archive/ - Inactive items
- {templates_folder}/ - Note templates
- {attachments_folder}/ - Media files

## Daily Notes

Location: {daily_folder}/
Format: YYYY-MM-DD.md
Template: {daily_template}

## Naming Convention

Zettelkasten: YYYYMMDDHHMM short-title.md

See `second-brain:obsidian/references/zettelkasten.md` for details.

## Routing Rules

1. Quick capture? → {inbox_folder}/
2. Today's log? → {daily_folder}/{date}.md
3. Has deadline/deliverable? → Projects/
4. Ongoing responsibility? → Areas/
5. Reference material? → Resources/
6. Done/inactive? → Archive/

See `second-brain:obsidian/references/para.md` for PARA methodology.

## Note Patterns

See `second-brain:obsidian/references/note-patterns.md` for templates:
- Insight notes
- Meeting notes
- Person notes
- Investigation notes
- Project notes

## Disambiguation Rules

When routing suggests similar areas, add disambiguation rules to help the algorithm choose correctly. See `second-brain:obsidian/references/routing.md` for the full guide.

### Example: Disambiguation Section

```markdown
### Disambiguation: {area1} vs {area2}

#### {area1} ({context})
Notes about [what belongs here].

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| {category} | {tool1}, {tool2} |

**Key question:** "{Question - if YES, route here}"

#### {area2} ({context})
Notes about [what belongs here].

**Key question:** "{Question - if YES, route here}"

#### Edge cases
| Scenario | Route to | Reasoning |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| {example} | {area} | {why} |
```

Add disambiguation sections below for areas with semantic overlap in YOUR vault.
